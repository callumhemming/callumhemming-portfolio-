            From studying Psychology, to Film, to 3D Printing, I've always been
            drawn tocrafts that require a mixture of critical thinking, problem
            solving and out of-the-box creativity. In my final year of
            University, the impact of the pandemiccreated a seemingly unsolvable
            problem; creating a film in a pandemic. Isolved this problem by
            turning my story in code. I taught myself basic HTML , CSS and
            JAVASCRIPT I found that I was utterly enthralled in the code and in
            a life changing twist, Iwas served an advert for the School of Code
            and haven't looked back. I've gonefrom DOM manipulation to eloquent
            React , I can now effortlessly connect abackend to a frontend,
            controlling data from a user, all the way to a PostgreSQL database.
            Since the School Of Code, I've become a true believer in the Agile
            methodology,especially paired programming , which I've found
            incredibly efficient Half these terms I had never heard of 4 months
            ago. I'm a fast and obsessive learner , a true team player and
            incredibly excited tostart a new career in tech
